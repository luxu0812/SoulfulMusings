Dearest reader, it is with great honor that I present this work to you, and I am truly grateful for your interest. Before we embark upon this journey together, allow me to briefly outline my intentions in creating this piece, the content it explores, and the significance I hope it holds. In doing so, I wish to ensure that you will find something within these pages that captures your imagination and speaks to your heart.

Born in October of 1986, I now stand at the threshold of my 36th year. Though I harbor few regrets about my past, I cannot help but feel that my life has been wanting for meaning. It is with this in mind that I have endeavored to chronicle my experiences through the written word, in the hope that my humble tale might serve as a single grain of sand within the vast and ever-shifting sands of human history. May it offer those of differing backgrounds, nationalities, and eras a window into the lives and minds of those who shared my time, place, and social standing.

My childhood, education, and professional experiences all took place within the vast expanse of mainland China. My parents were ordinary workers in a state-owned military-industrial enterprise, manufacturing ammunition and weaponry. Amidst the Chinese government's "reform and opening-up" policies, the company transformed into a producer of automotive components. If I were to distill the essence of my work into a few keywords, it would be these: mainland China, reform and opening-up, and working-class family.

With this introduction, shall we begin our journey together? Follow me, dear reader, as I guide you through the world as I have seen and experienced it.
