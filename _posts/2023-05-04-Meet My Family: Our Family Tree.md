Hello, everyone! Today, I'm excited to share with you my family tree. Our family history is something that has always fascinated me, and I wanted to take the time to create a visual representation of our lineage. I hope that this post will give you a glimpse into the rich heritage and relationships that have shaped our family.

Starting from the top, you'll see my paternal and maternal grandparents. My paternal grandfather, Hai Lu (卢 海), and my paternal grandmother, Xiuzhi Zhao (赵 秀芝), together had five children, including my father, Wanxiang Lu (卢 万祥). On my mother's side, my maternal grandfather, Jiuxiang Li (李 久祥), and my maternal grandmother, Ruxia Xiao (萧 如霞), had three children, including my mother, Wenbo Li (李 文波).

My father has four siblings: Yushu Lu (卢 玉书), Yuqin Lu (卢 玉琴), WanYuan Lu (卢 万元), and Wanli Lu (卢 万利). My mother also has two siblings: Wenjun Li (李 文军) and Wentao Li (李 文涛).

I, Xu Lu (卢 旭), was born on October 29, 1986. I am fortunate to have found my life partner, Xuli Zhong (钟 旭丽), who was born on May 13, 1984. Together, we have been blessed with a beautiful daughter, Youxuan Lu (卢 宥萱), who was born on August 12, 2021.

Our family tree not only represents our lineage but also symbolizes the love, support, and connection we all share as a family. I am proud of our family's history and grateful for the bond we share. By sharing our family tree with you, I hope to inspire you to learn more about your own family history and cherish the relationships that make your family unique.
