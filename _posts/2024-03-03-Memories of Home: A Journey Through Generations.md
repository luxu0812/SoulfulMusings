My parents sold their oldest house, where I spent most of my childhood. It's regrettable that I didn't have the opportunity to show my daughter where her father grew up. I still remember when the building's foundation was being dug, my friends and I used the excavated dirt piles as slides. I recall doing math homework on the balcony of that house in the evenings when I was probably not even ten years old. I would sneakily watch TV dramas in the living room. In the bedroom, I'd enjoy spicy beef jerky, which cost $3 a bag, while reading world classics. At noon, when my parents were away, I'd secretly play on the computer. My mother, during her one-hour lunch break from work, would come home to make me lunch. When I was in junior high, she would wake up at five in the morning to prepare breakfast for me before sending me off. Time flies, and before I knew it, more than half of my life has passed.

Warm regards,
