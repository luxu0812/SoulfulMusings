In the realm of organizing individuals into a complex entity, there exists a solution space. Within this solution space, we have two subsets: feasible solutions, which we can also refer to as viable organizational forms, and unfeasible solutions, which can be labeled as nonviable organizational forms.

Concrete instances of organizing problems can be exemplified as follows:
1. Organizing chemical elements to form compounds.
2. Assembling parts to create machinery.
3. Bringing people together to form groups.

In my work, I aim to explore the solution space of organizing people to form groups. This exploration encompasses several facets:
1. Known feasible solutions.
2. Known unfeasible solutions.
3. Identifying commonalities among known feasible solutions.
4. Identifying commonalities among known unfeasible solutions.
5. Venturing into new feasible solutions that are more efficient in achieving objectives.

Known feasible solutions can be categorized into various forms (are there any new forms?):
1. Administrative institutions.
2. Social organizations.
3. Religious institutions.
4. Businesses.
5. Military organizations.
6. Factions.
7. Families.
8. Clans.

Each form includes several different feasible solutions.

Theory 1: A commonality among feasible solutions is a balance of power; conversely, a commonality among unfeasible solutions is an imbalance of power. <br>
Inference 1: Larger, more diverse organizations tend to achieve a better balance of power, while smaller, less diverse organizations struggle to maintain balance. <br>
Inference 2: An organization in the process of shrinking and becoming more monotonous will generate a significant imbalance of power.

Theory 2: Forces related to an organization can be divided into internal member interactions and interactions between the organization and the external environment. <br>
Inference 1: Organizations need to obtain energy from external sources to maintain internal order. <br>
Inference 2: When an organization is unable to obtain sufficient energy externally, it may need to eliminate internal members and convert them into energy to sustain the remaining members' order. <br>

Theory 3: Forces among internal organization members can be categorized as attractive forces and repulsive forces. <br>
Inference 1: When attractive forces exceed repulsive forces, an organization can maintain its integrity; conversely, it will disintegrate. <br>
Inference 2: Attractive forces encompass factors like blood ties, shared values, aligned interests, harmonious relationships, and contracts. <br>
Inference 3: Repulsive forces, in contrast, involve factors like lacking blood ties, differing values, conflicting interests, and disharmonious relationships. <br>
Inference 4: Blood ties and contracts are the most enduring attractive forces. <br>
Inference 5: Values, interests, and emotions are more changeable. <br>
Inference 6: It is challenging to establish a large, diverse organization based on changeable forces, as seen in Chinese society, making it unreliable and unstable. <br>
Inference 7: Establishing a large, diverse organization based on less changeable forces, as observed in Western societies, leads to reliability and stability.
